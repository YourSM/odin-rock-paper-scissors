# odin-rock-paper-scissors
This is a project for the The Odin Project curriculum
where I created a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors!

The player can select one of the three options
in the UI and battle against a computer!

The game consists of five rounds and resets
after announcing the winner.

This work showcases my skills with JavaScript and
my problem-solving abilities! In particular, I
was tasked with creating efficient functions
and manipulating the DOM to back the UI.
